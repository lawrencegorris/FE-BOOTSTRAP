# FRONT END-BOOTSTRAP
A little assignment to get familiar with Bootstrap
## The Site
Site has basic markup and only styled with Bootstrap (no custom css)
When on the home page, clicking on the 'LEARN MORE' button will direct the user to the info page.
### Styling
Will be very minimal and Bootstrap-esque
